# emscripten-webgl-loader
A very simple page that runs an Emscripten-generated [Panda3D WebGL](https://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=17771) application and provides a user-friendly loading screen.
While the application's asm.js script is downloading, a progress meter is displayed.
<br><br>The pview-panda.js example Emscripten application included was compiled by [rdb](https://github.com/rdb).
